## Entry for Ludum Dare 32 (Compo): "An Unconventional Weapon"

Technologies used include [Phaser](https://phaser.io) for the overall game, [Aseprite](http://www.aseprite.org) for spriting, [CFXR](http://thirdcog.eu/apps/cfxr) for sound effect generation, and [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net) for one audio file that needed changing.

You can run the game locally by running any web server. During development, I used [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

With npm installed, you can run the following:

`npm install http-server -g`

Followed by running `http-server` in the cloned repository's directory.
